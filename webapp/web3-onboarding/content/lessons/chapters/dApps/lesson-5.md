# How to transfer tokens from wallet to wallet

Transferring ERC20 tokens between Web3 wallets is a fundamental skill for anyone interacting with the Ethereum ecosystem. In this lesson, we'll walk through the process of sending tokens from one MetaMask wallet to another.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have:

1. Two MetaMask wallets installed (Wallet A and Wallet B)
2. Some ERC20 tokens in Wallet A
3. Sufficient ETH in Wallet A to cover gas fees

## Steps to Transfer Tokens

1. Open MetaMask and ensure you're using Wallet A
2. Click on the token you want to transfer to view your balance
3. Click "Send"
4. In the "Add Recipient" field, enter the address of Wallet B
   - You can find the address of Wallet B by opening MetaMask, switching to Wallet B, and copying the account address
5. Enter the amount of tokens you want to transfer
6. Adjust the gas fee if necessary (higher fees may result in faster transaction processing)
7. Double-check the recipient address and amount
8. Click "Next" to review the transaction details
9. If everything looks correct, click "Confirm" to send the transaction
10. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the Ethereum network
    - You can check the transaction status in MetaMask or on a block explorer like Etherscan

Once the transaction is confirmed, the transferred tokens will appear in Wallet B.

## Key Takeaways

- Transferring ERC20 tokens between Web3 wallets involves sending tokens from one wallet address to another
- Always double-check the recipient address and amount before confirming a transaction
- Ensure you have sufficient ETH in the sending wallet to cover gas fees
- Transactions may take some time to be confirmed on the Ethereum network, depending on network congestion and the gas fee you set

## Practice Exercise

Set up two MetaMask wallets (if you haven't already) and practice transferring a small amount of ERC20 tokens between them. Familiarize yourself with the process of sending tokens, adjusting gas fees, and checking transaction status. You can use test networks like Ropsten or Rinkeby and obtain test tokens from faucets to avoid using real funds.
