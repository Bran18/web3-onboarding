# What are NFTs?

Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, are unique digital assets that represent ownership of a specific item or piece of content. Unlike fungible tokens like Bitcoin or Ethereum, each NFT is distinct and cannot be exchanged for another on a one-to-one basis. In this lesson, we'll explore the basics of NFTs and their unique properties.

## Unique Digital Assets

NFTs are unique digital assets that are verified on a blockchain network. They can represent a wide range of items, including:

1. Digital art
2. Collectibles
3. Virtual real estate
4. In-game items
5. Music and video content
6. Tickets and passes

Each NFT has its own unique identifier and metadata that distinguishes it from other tokens.

## Proof of Ownership

NFTs provide a way to prove ownership and authenticity of digital assets. When an NFT is minted (created) and sold, the ownership is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable record of the asset's provenance.

Benefits of NFT ownership:
1. Verifiable uniqueness and scarcity
2. Transparent and secure transfer of ownership
3. Potential for royalty payments to the original creator on secondary market sales
4. Increased control over the distribution and monetization of digital content

## ERC-721 and ERC-1155 Standards

Most NFTs are created using one of two Ethereum token standards: ERC-721 or ERC-1155.

ERC-721:
- Defines a minimum interface for NFTs
- Each token is unique and has a single owner
- Suitable for one-of-a-kind assets like digital art or collectibles

ERC-1155:
- Allows for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens in a single contract
- Enables more efficient token transfers and reduced gas costs
- Suitable for applications like gaming, where users may own multiple copies of certain items

## Use Cases and Applications

NFTs have a wide range of potential use cases and applications across various industries.

Examples of NFT use cases:
1. Digital art and collectibles - enabling artists to monetize their work and collectors to prove ownership
2. Gaming - allowing players to truly own and trade in-game assets
3. Virtual real estate - representing ownership of land and property in virtual worlds
4. Tickets and passes - providing secure and verifiable access to events and experiences
5. Intellectual property - managing and licensing IP rights for digital content

## NFT Marketplaces

NFT marketplaces are platforms where users can buy, sell, and discover NFTs.

Popular NFT marketplaces:
1. OpenSea - the largest NFT marketplace supporting various blockchain networks
2. Rarible - a community-owned NFT marketplace with a focus on art and collectibles
3. Nifty Gateway - a curated NFT marketplace known for its high-profile drops and collaborations
4. SuperRare - a selective NFT marketplace for single-edition digital artworks
