# Common Attack Vectors

As the Web3 ecosystem grows, so do the potential threats and attack vectors. Familiarizing yourself with common attack methods employed by malicious actors is crucial for protecting your digital assets and personal information. In this lesson, we'll explore some of the most prevalent attack vectors in the Web3 space.

## Phishing Attacks

Phishing attacks aim to trick users into revealing their private keys, seed phrases, or personal information by impersonating legitimate websites, dApps, or individuals.

Common phishing techniques:
1. Fake websites that mimic the UI and URL of popular dApps or exchanges
2. Scam emails or messages claiming to be from a trusted source, often containing malicious links or attachments
3. Social media impersonation of well-known figures or projects in the Web3 space
4. Phishing pop-ups or overlays that appear while interacting with a legitimate dApp

## Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

Smart contract vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to drain funds, manipulate data, or disrupt the normal functioning of a dApp.

Common smart contract vulnerabilities:
1. Reentrancy attacks - exploiting recursive calling vulnerabilities to drain funds from a contract
2. Integer overflow/underflow - manipulating arithmetic operations to bypass checks and balances
3. Unhandled exceptions - exploiting contracts that fail to properly handle errors or edge cases
4. Timestamp dependence - manipulating block timestamps to influence contract behavior

## 51% Attacks

In a 51% attack, a malicious actor gains control of the majority of the network's mining power or staked tokens, allowing them to manipulate transactions and double-spend funds.

Factors that increase the risk of 51% attacks:
1. Smaller, less secure blockchain networks with lower hash rates or staked value
2. Centralization of mining power or staked tokens among a few entities
3. Lack of network upgrades or security measures to mitigate 51% attacks

## Frontrunning

Frontrunning occurs when an attacker exploits the knowledge of pending transactions to gain an unfair advantage, often by submitting their own transaction with a higher gas price to be executed first.

Common frontrunning scenarios:
1. Arbitrage opportunities on decentralized exchanges (DEXes)
2. Manipulating the outcome of decentralized auctions or token sales
3. Exploiting price oracle updates to profit from mispriced assets

## Wallet Hacks

Wallet hacks involve unauthorized access to a user's wallet, allowing the attacker to steal funds or personal information.

Common wallet hack techniques:
1. Exploiting vulnerabilities in wallet software or browser extensions
2. Accessing unsecured private keys or seed phrases stored online or on a device
3. Tricking users into granting permissions to malicious dApps or contracts

## Social Engineering

Social engineering attacks rely on psychological manipulation to trick users into making decisions that compromise their security.

Common social engineering tactics:
1. Impersonating trusted figures or organizations to gain credibility
2. Creating a false sense of urgency or scarcity to pressure users into acting quickly
3. Exploiting human emotions such as greed, fear, or curiosity
4. Offering seemingly legitimate investment opportunities or giveaways to entice users
