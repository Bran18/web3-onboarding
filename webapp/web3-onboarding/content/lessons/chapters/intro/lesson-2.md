# Introduction to Web3 and Blockchain

In this lesson, we'll explore the concepts of Web3 and blockchain technology, and how they enable the creation of decentralized applications (dApps).

## What is Web3?

Web3, short for "Web 3.0," refers to the next generation of the internet, which aims to be more decentralized, trustless, and permissionless compared to the current Web 2.0. Web3 builds upon the principles of decentralization and leverages blockchain technology to enable new models of interaction and value exchange.

Key characteristics of Web3:
1. Decentralization of data and infrastructure
2. Trustless interactions through cryptographic proofs
3. Permissionless participation and innovation
4. Native digital assets and value exchange

## What is Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that forms the backbone of Web3. It is essentially a decentralized, immutable database that records transactions across a network of computers. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions and is linked to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks (hence the name "blockchain").

Key features of blockchain technology:
1. Decentralized consensus mechanism
2. Immutable and tamper-evident record of transactions
3. Transparency and auditability
4. Smart contract functionality for automating business logic

## Decentralized Applications (dApps)

Decentralized applications, or dApps, are applications that run on a decentralized network, such as a blockchain, rather than on a single computer or server. dApps leverage Web3 technologies to enable trustless interactions, decentralized governance, and new models of value creation and exchange.

Examples of dApps:
1. Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms for lending, borrowing, and trading
2. Non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces for digital art and collectibles
3. Decentralized social networks and content platforms
4. Supply chain management and provenance tracking systems

## Key Takeaways

- Web3 aims to create a more decentralized, trustless, and permissionless internet
- Blockchain technology enables the decentralized infrastructure and value exchange mechanisms of Web3
- Decentralized applications (dApps) leverage Web3 technologies to enable new models of interaction and value creation

## Practice Exercise

Research a popular dApp in the Web3 ecosystem (e.g., Uniswap, OpenSea, Decentraland). Identify the key features that make it a decentralized application and discuss how it leverages Web3 technologies to enable new forms of interaction and value exchange.
