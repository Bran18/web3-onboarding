# Introduction to DeFi

Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is a rapidly growing ecosystem of financial applications and services built on blockchain networks. DeFi aims to create a more open, accessible, and transparent financial system by leveraging smart contracts and decentralized protocols. In this lesson, we'll explore the basics of DeFi and its key advantages over traditional finance.

## What is DeFi?

DeFi refers to the shift from traditional, centralized financial systems to peer-to-peer finance enabled by decentralized technologies built on the Ethereum blockchain. DeFi applications and services are built using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

Key characteristics of DeFi:
1. Decentralization - no central authority controls the financial services or user funds
2. Transparency - all transactions and smart contract code are publicly auditable on the blockchain
3. Permissionless - anyone with an internet connection can access DeFi services without needing approval from a central authority
4. Interoperability - DeFi applications can interact with each other and build on top of existing protocols

## Advantages of DeFi

DeFi offers several advantages over traditional financial systems, making it an attractive alternative for users seeking more control, transparency, and accessibility.

Key advantages of DeFi:
1. Accessible to anyone - DeFi removes barriers to entry and enables financial inclusion for the unbanked and underbanked populations
2. No intermediaries - DeFi eliminates the need for intermediaries like banks, reducing costs and increasing efficiency
3. Transparency and immutability - all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability
4. Increased control - users have complete control over their funds and can interact with DeFi services directly from their Web3 wallets
5. Innovative financial products - DeFi enables the creation of new financial products and services that are not possible in traditional finance

## Key Components of DeFi

The DeFi ecosystem consists of various components that work together to provide a wide range of financial services.

Key components of DeFi:
1. Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) - platforms that allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly from their Web3 wallets without a central authority
2. Lending and borrowing platforms - protocols that enable users to lend or borrow cryptocurrencies and earn interest on their holdings
3. Stablecoins - cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value relative to a reference asset, such as the US dollar
4. Yield farming - the practice of lending or staking cryptocurrencies to earn rewards in the form of additional tokens
5. Prediction markets - platforms that allow users to bet on the outcome of future events using cryptocurrencies

## Risks and Challenges
